	      	<dt>Tennis</dt>

	      		<dd>Tennis is my favorite sport and I have been playing it for about 6 years now. I play at a competetive level right now and also play for Lawson Tennis, which came second place last year. and has won the championships 4 times in a row. I am currently trying to work my way up to the top of the USTA league, but i'll get there one day.</dd>

	      	<dt>Kung Fu<dt> 


	      		<dd>I started Kung Fu at the age of five, and now I am a First Degree Black-Belt, and I have been to many competitions, and performances. I am aiming for a gold medal in the competition coming up this august.</dd>
	      			<br>
	      	<dt>Soccer</dt>
	      		<dd>I got an interest in soccer very late during fourth grade. I played for the team at my elementary school, then came to Lawson middle, still considering it my main sport. But then I had to make the choice between soccer and tennis. I chose Tennis knowing the cometition there was at Lawson. Even tody I dont play soccer much as I just keep that skill for use when I will need to play with friends for fun. I still follow up with the news about soccer.
